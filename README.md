# üîê Simple Cryptography Toolkit (Python)
This project is a graphical tool written in Python that lets a user experiment with two encryption schemes, namely RSA (Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman) and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). The tool helps in generating keys, encrypting and decrypting messages, and signing and verifying data.

## Features
- Symmetric encryption (e.g., Caesar cipher, Vigen√®re cipher, or AES)
- Optional asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA)
- File and text-based encryption
- User-friendly CLI or GUI (if applicable)

## Getting Started
1. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Technologies
- Python
- `cryptography`, `pycryptodome`, or built-in modules
- Command-line or GUI interface

## Educational Use
Great for learning about:
- Symmetric vs Asymmetric encryption
- Key generation and storage
- Practical security concerns in encryption

## Future Enhancements
- Add password-based encryption (PBKDF2)
- Integration with file system for secure backups
- Secure message sharing over networks
