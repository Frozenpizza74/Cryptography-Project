# Cryptography-Project
This project is a graphical tool written in Python that lets a user experiment with two encryption schemes, namely RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). The tool helps in generating keys, encrypting and decrypting messages, and signing and verifying data.
